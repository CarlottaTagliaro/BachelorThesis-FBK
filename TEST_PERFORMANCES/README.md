`minimal.py` and `minimal_tls_1_3.py` have been used to perform the first test when testing TLS (1.2 and 1.3 respectively) with a fixed payload size and different ciphers.

`counter.py` has been used to perform a burst test.

`payload_tls_1_2.py` and `payload_tls_1_3.py` have been used to test TLS (1.2 and 1.3) with growing packet sizes.
